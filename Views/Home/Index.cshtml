        <p class="lead">
            Macedonia, country of the south-central Balkans. It is bordered to the north by Kosovo and Serbia
            , to the east by Bulgaria, to the south by Greece, and to the west by Albania. The capital is Skopje.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Geologically,  Macedonia consists mainly of heavily folded ancient metamorphic rocks, which in
            the west have been eroded to reveal older granites. In the central region are found sedimentary
            deposits of more recent age. Traversing the country from north to south is a series of active
            fault lines, along which earthquakes frequently occur. The most severe of these in recent history
            occurred at Debar in 1967.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            Skopje was largely destroyed by an earthquake in 1963North Macedonia
            is largely mountainous, with many peaks rising above the tree line at 6,600 feet (2,000 metres)
            above sea level. The highest elevation is at Mount Korab (9,030 feet, or 2,752 metres) on the
            Albanian border. Near the Šar Mountains in the northwest, the country is covered with forest.
            Where this has been cleared (and often in the past overgrazed), the thin skeletal soils have
            been subjected to dramatic erosion and gullying. There are also several broad and fertile
            valleys that provide good potential for agriculture.
